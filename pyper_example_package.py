    '''
    Linear Mixed Effects Models computation for one fixed effect and one 
    random effect.
    This function uses the R packages "lme4" and "stats".
       
    The response variable is modeled using two linear mixed effect models 
    (Model and Nullmodel) of the form: 
    - xs~treatment+(1+treatment|timeunit)  
      (Random intercept + random slope model)
    - xs~(1+treatment|timeunit) 
      (Nullmodel without the fixed effect "treatment")
    
    Both models are compared in R using "anova" (from the R-package "stats")
    which performs a likelihood ratio test to obtain the p-Value for the 
    significance of the fixed effect (treatment).
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    xs: list of nx1 arrays
        a list of response variables (eg. Deformations)
    treatment: list of 1x1 arrays
               a list which contains 1x1 arrays (of an integer values 
               or strings) that describe the fixed effect.
               
    timeunit: list of 1x1 arrays
              a list which contains 1x1 arrays (of an integer values 
              or strings) that describe the random effect.
              
    Returns
    -------
    Linear Mixed Effects Model Result: dictionary
    The dictionary contains:
    -Estimate:  the average value of cells that had Treatment 1
    -Fixed Effect: Change of the estimate value due to the Treatment 2
    -Std Error for the Estimate
    -Std Error for the Fixed Effect
    -p-Value
